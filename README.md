# Priama

A local-first desktop writing application for authors. Built with Electron, React, TypeScript, TipTap, and a file-based `.tomes` project format.

- **Book Projects** — Each project is a portable folder with a `project.tomes` entry file
- **Manuscript** — Chapters and scenes with drag-and-drop reordering
- **Wiki** — Characters, locations, and lore entries with rich metadata
- **Rich Text Editor** — TipTap with entity mentions, autosave, and export
- **Zip Backups** — Automatic backups on save to local and configured destinations
- **100% Offline** — No accounts, no cloud, no telemetry
